# Android Malware Analysis

## Introduction
An Android Malware Detection system built in python that classifies a given android app as malware or benign.

## Working

The system does **static analysis of the Manifest XML file** of the android app and gives the result. The system does the static analysis by using a pre-generated data file containing frequent patterns from 35000 malware applications and 70000 benign applications. This analysis generates the features of the input applications. These features are nothing but the *similarity scores* calculated by comparing XML Manifest file of the input application to the frequent patterns of the benign and malware applications.

The system then uses a trained Machine Learning model to classify the application. This model was trained using Random Forest Algorithm on 15000 benign applications and 8500 malware applications. *Similarity scores* for all these 23500 applications were calculated and the dataset generated was used to train the classifier.
